Digital machinery launched into space is exposed to a number of
environmental hazards not normally encountered in operation on
earth. This includes dangers such as solar flares, cosmic background
radiation etc.\cite{nasa}

One way of coping with these problems is to introduce redundancy in
your system design by duplicating elements. For instance, instead of
using a single microprocessor to perform relevant calculations, you
might use four of them. This way the system can continue its operation
even while facing
