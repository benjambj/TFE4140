\section{Description of problem}
All public sound reinforcement systems that require the use of a microphone have one problem in common, they all have to address the problem of acoustic feedback. This degrades the performance of the system and can cause unpleasant howling, which in worst case can cause damage to the system itself or the audiences ears. Usually this is solved manually by sound technicians, this however, demands a lot of practice and technical knowledge of the system. 
\section{Description of solution}
The solution proposed is an automatic system for reducing the risk and duration of unpleasant howling in public sound reinforcement systems. This will be done by detecting the frequency of the howling and reducing the volume on said frequency.
