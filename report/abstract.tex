This report contains our solution to the term project in the course
TFE4140. We describe our design of a liaison system implemented on an
FPGA, aimed at performing a majority vote amongst microcontrollers
transmitting data words serially. The main focus of our implementation
was to keep the area usage as low as possible, measured in the number
of LUTs used on the FPGA. We discuss alternative solutions, and
examine their relative strenghts and weaknesses.  Our proposed
solution uses 31 LUTs, and runs with a clock frequency of 298.7 MHz.
