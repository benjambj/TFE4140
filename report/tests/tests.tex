The liaison system was verified utilizing automated testbenches. The testbenches uses VHDL assertions to notify the tester if some
tests failed. In order to create a good, short but extensive testbench, we have built a collection of procedures that takes input, expected output
and expected system status after all input has been sent. The test cases was divided into three blocks.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first test block consists of 8 tests that asserts the normal behaviour. It is done with some easy cases and a 2 cycle delay between inputs.

\item The second test block consists of 24 corner case tests where our design was likly to have flaws. During development, these tests were
triggered often, proving their value.   

\item The third and last test block is a permutation of all fail states (including all working), and for each possible state, let all MCUs send
all possible inputs (all MCUs sends the same value to keep the number of tests down to an affordable number). This block consists of 16 836 different test cases.
\end{itemize}
