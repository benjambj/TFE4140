Overall, we were able to verify most of both the hardware and software prototypes behaviour during the testing.

Testing the hardware was simple since the task it performs is simple. 

The overall design of the software prototype was created with testing and verification in mind, this simplified the job of isolating the modules in order to perform individual verification them.

Our two prototypes passed all of our tests, giving an important indication that the system being designed is well implemented.
