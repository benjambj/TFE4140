Since the hardware prototype only consists of a front-end interface and a back-end interface, only one test was conducted. In this test we verified that when we connected the front-end to the back-end, the sound went through the system without being distorted, or changed in any unwanted way.

The volume control and the volume control amplifiers were removed and bypassed. The feedback resistors in the output amplifiers of the output interface were changed to a higher value. The coupling capacitors of the input were changed to a higher value due to missing components. 

The frequency response was measured. This shows that the cut-off frequency was different than expected. The low-pass filter had a cut-off frequency much lower than expected. There is a measurement note that shows this. The filter response was not so low as to distort the sound experience in any noticeable way.
