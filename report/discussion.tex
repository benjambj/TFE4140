\subsection{Lifetime Expectancy Calculations}
To perform the required lifetime expectancy calculations, some
assumptions about the stochastic behaviour of the microcontrollers are
made. An assumption that was provided by the problem text, was that
the expected lifetime of a single microcontroller was six years. In
addition to this, we assumed that the lifetime of each microcontroller
followed an exponential probability distribution, and that their
individual lifetimes are independent. 

The first assumption is made because the exponential distribution is
simple to use for calculations. Even though it is not suitable for describing the lifetime of an entire technical device\cite{wikipedia} while still providing an estimate of
how the system behaves. It was also suggested by the course staff. 

The second assumption is also 

\subsection{Possible Simplifications}
Overall parity bit simplification?

Assumption that microcontroller data can be used for error tagging
even outside of the di_ready+8cycles intervals?

\subsection{Alternative Solutions}
- Different voting algorithms
- Simultaneous calculation of error tags and voted data (is it on critical path?)
- Store data in register and calculate ECC from these instead of on the fly?
- More as described in technote?
