\subsection{Lifetime Expectancy Calculations}
To perform the required lifetime expectancy calculations, some
assumptions about the stochastic behaviour of the microcontrollers are
made. An assumption that was provided by the problem text, was that
the expected lifetime of a single microcontroller was six years. In
addition to this, we assumed that the lifetime of each microcontroller
followed an exponential probability distribution, and that their
individual lifetimes are independent. 

The first assumption is made because the exponential distribution is
simple to use for calculations. Even though it is not suitable for
describing the lifetime of an entire technical device, it is used
extensively in reliability theory\cite{wikipedia}. Thus, it should
providing an estimate of how the system behaves. It was also suggested
by the course staff.

The second assumption is also somewhat optimistic, since the
microcontrollers are exposed to the same environmental hazards at the
same time. For instance, a solar flare will most likely strike all the
microcontrollers simultaneously, and thus microcontroller lifetimes
are likely to have a non-zero covariance. The assumption is still made
to make the calculations easier. If a more accurate model is
desirable, dependence should be taken into account.

With these assumptions, $f(t) = \frac{1}{6}e^{-\frac{1}{6}t}$ is the
probability density function of a failure event for an individual
microcontroller, and $F(t) = 1 - e^{-\frac{1}{6}t}$ is the
corresponding cumulative distribution giving the probability that the
microcontroller has failed within time $t$. Consequently, we can
define $P(t) := 1 - F(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{6}t}$ to be the probability
that the microcontroller has not failed within time $t$. Assuming as
we have that each microcontroller is independent, we can view the
potential of failure within a given time as a Bernoulli trial for each
of the microcontrollers. Consequently, the probability that exactly
$r$ microcontrollers have not failed within time $t$, as a function of
$t$, is given by $Q(r) = \binom{4}{r}P(t)^4(1 - P(t))^{4 - r})$. With
this framework, we can begin answering the questions stated in
\autoref{sec:problem}.

\subsubsection{Calculation of Probability of Error in Maximum One Controller}
\label{sec:errorinmaxone}
The probability that at most one controller has failed is the
probability that either four or three controllers are still
working. Since these two events are independent---there cannot be both
exactly four and exactly three microcontrollers that are still working
at a point in time---the total probability is the sum of the
probability of each event. Hence, the probability of an error in at
most one controller within a given time $t$ is given by

\begin{align*}
    Q(4) + Q(3) &= \binom{4}{4}P(t)^4 + \binom{4}{3}P(t)^3(1 - P(t)) \\
                &= (e^{-\frac{t}{6}})^4  + 4 (e^{-\frac{t}{6}})^3(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{6}}) \\
                &= 
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Calculation of Probability of Error in Maximum Two Controllers}
\label{sec:errorinmaxtwo}
This probability is the same as the probability that either exactly
four, exactly three or exactly two microcontrollers are still working
by time $t$. By the same logic as given in
\autoref{sec:errorinmaxone}, this is the same as
\begin{align*}
  &Q(4) + Q(3) + Q(2) = \\
  &\binom{4}{4}P(t)^4 + \binom{4}{3}P(t)^3(1 - P(t)) + \binom{4}{2}P(t)^2(1 - P(t))^2 = \\
  &
\end{align*}

This function describes the probability that the system is still alive
within time $t$. For future reference, we shall denote it as $R(t)$.

\subsubsection{Calculation of Probability in At Least Three Controllers}
\label{sec:errorinatleastthree}
At least three controllers being broken within time $t$ is the
complement of the event that at most two controllers have failed
within time $t$. Thus, this probability is simply the negation of the
result derived in \autoref{sec:errorinmaxtwo}, which is
\begin{align*}
  1 - R(t) = 1 - (Q(4) + Q(3) + Q(2)) = 
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Mean Time to Failure}
The mean time to system failure is the expected value of a stochastic
variable $X$ denoting time until at least three microcontrollers have
failed. Now, $Prob\{X \le t\} = Prob\{\text{System has failed within
  time } t\}$, so the cumulative distribution function of $X$,
$F_X(t)$, is given by the result in
\autoref{sec:errorinatleastthree}. If we denote the probability
density function of $X$ by $f_X(t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial
  t}F_x(t)$, we get that

\begin{align*}
  E[X] &= \int_0^{\infty}tf_X(t)dt = \int_0^{\infty}t\frac{\partial}{\partial t} F_X(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}[tF_X(t)]_{0}^b - \int_0^{\infty}F_X(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}[tF_X(t)]_0^b - \int_0^{\infty}1 - R(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}[tF_X(t)]_0^b - \int_0^\infty1dt + \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}[tF_X(t)]_0^{\infty} - \lim_{b \to \infty}[t]_0^b + \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}(bF_X(b) - 0F_X(0)) - \lim_{b \to \infty}(b - 0) + \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}bF_X(b) - \lim_{b \to \infty}b + \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}b\lim_{b \to \infty}F_X(b) - \lim_{b \to \infty}b + \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt \\
       &= \lim_{b \to \infty}(b - b) + \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt \\
       &= \int_0^{\infty}R(t)dt
\end{align*}

%\begin{align*}
%x = 3
%Q(4) + Q(3) &= P(t)^4 + \binom{4}{3}P(t)^3(1 - P(t)) 
%             &= (e^{\frac{t}{6}})^4  + 4 (e^{\frac{t}{6}})^3(1 - e^{\frac{t}{6}})

\subsection{Possible Simplifications}
Overall parity bit simplification?

Assumption that microcontroller data can be used for error tagging
even outside of the di\_ready+8cycles intervals?

\subsection{Alternative Solutions}
- Different voting algorithms
- Simultaneous calculation of error tags and voted data (is it on critical path?)
- Store data in register and calculate ECC from these instead of on the fly?
- More as described in technote?
