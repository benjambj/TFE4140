\subsection{Lifetime Expectancy Calculations}


\subsection{Possible Simplifications}
Overall parity bit simplification?

Assumption that microcontroller data can be used for error tagging
even outside of the di_ready+8cycles intervals?

\subsection{Alternative Solutions}
- Different voting algorithms
- Simultaneous calculation of error tags and voted data (is it on critical path?)
- Store data in register and calculate ECC from these instead of on the fly?
- More as described in technote?
